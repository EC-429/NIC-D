# The network interface diagnostics tool (NIC-D) has been created to help individuals better understand
# the network connections that are active on their host.

# This project is coded in python3 and meant to be run on MacOS X

# Later versions of this project will be ported to different environments, but for now is only 
# capable of being run on mac/linux.

# As this is my first GitHub project, this tool is not that awe inspiring to please feel free so give
# advice, ideas, and opinions on how it can be improved!

# Thanks.
